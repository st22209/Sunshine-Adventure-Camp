# Sunshine Adventure Camp

This is the code for my CSC2 practice assessment.  
The project is split into two parts - the api and the app.  
Both folders contain a readme which will help you navigate the code. The API contains all the code for actualy managing the data (creating, deleting, editing, getting) while the app provides a gui interface for the user to be able to use the app easily.

### Scenario:
Sunshine Adventure Camp is a facility that looks after 11 to 15 year olds during the
winter and is only for the toughest kids. Groups go bush with a leader and fend for
themselves. Each night the group leader radios in with their name, where they are,
the number of campers and the current weather conditions. Each morning the
camp leader radios in again to say if they are planning to stay or move on. Groups
are always between 5 and 10 campers.
You need to write a program that stores the required details. It also needs the
ability to delete the details if the camp is moving on, or kept if not moving on.
Your program must use an updateable list and a GUI.
Write the program. Make sure you include good comments and use constants.
